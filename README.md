# Hi there，I'm Serafin 👨🏽‍💻
- I code  (you could call me a Kotlin connoisseur)
- I've got a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science
- I like plants 🪴
- I mostly use private repos in GitHub, but I thought I'd give you a landing page to hang out in. Make yourself home! (and sorry there is so little public furniture in this house)
